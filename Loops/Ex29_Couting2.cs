/******************Block Comment***********************
 * Sean Berlin
 * Create a Console Application called Ex29_Counting2. 
 * Write code that uses a for loop that displays the numbers from 2 to 20 by twos, i.e., 2,4,6,8,10, etc. 
 * (hint use Number +=2 as the increment). Now have your program modify the count by 2â€™s backwards. 
 * Show both and ask the user if they would like to see it again.
 *  Remember appropriate methods and variable names. Comment, Comment, COMMENT!!!
